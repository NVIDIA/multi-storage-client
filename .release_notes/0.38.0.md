## New Features

This release adds support for composing MSC configurations from multiple files using the `include` keyword. The feature enables
teams to share common configs (telemetry, cache) while maintaining individual MSC config files. See the
[Configuration Reference](https://nvidia.github.io/multi-storage-client/references/configuration.html) for more details.

- Add `commit_metadata` (default `True`) to `StorageClient.sync_from` to auto-commit metadata after sync.

## Bug Fixes

- Make `sync_from` fail fast on errors and raise a `RuntimeError` with collected error details.
- Reduce POSIX sync lock overhead by only creating lock files for large objects (≥64MB).
- Fix metric exporter initialization error caused by a urllib3 version mismatch.
- Improve HuggingFace provider retries and error translation (including rate-limit context when available).
