## Breaking Changes

## New Features

- Added commit_metadata flag to `StorageClient.sync_from`.  When ``True`` (default), calls `StorageClient.commit_metadata` after sync completes.
Set to ``False`` to skip the commit, allowing batching of multiple sync operations before committing manually.
- Add multi-configuration support with `include` keyword to compose settings from multiple MSC config files.
