## Breaking Changes

- Drop tracing.

## New Features

This release introduces the Multi-Storage File System (MSFS), a POSIX-compatible client that enables applications to access object storage through standard POSIX file operations. While the Python Multi-Storage Client is designed for Python applications, MSFS addresses use cases where applications cannot or should not be modified, or where applications are implemented in other languages. Using FUSE, MSFS provides a POSIX access path to object storage while maintaining common mechanisms with the Python client, making it easy to adopt object storage across your entire technology stack without code changes. This initial release supports S3-compatible storage, with additional cloud providers planned for future releases. See the [MSFS documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/multi-storage-client/user_guide/multi_storage_file_system.html) for more details.

- Add telemetry support in MSFS.
- Add AWS config/credentials support to MSFS.
- Add AIStore S3 storage provider with configuration examples.
- Add file attribute support for MSC adaptors.
- Add `mru` and `purgefactor` parameters to cache configuration.
- Use Rust client for multipart uploads of large BytesIO objects for better performance.
- Implement proactive credential refresh in Rust client.
- Optimize `msc sync` by avoiding a temporary file when syncing to/from POSIX storage provider.
- Add `source_files` parameter to `sync_from()` method to allow syncing a specific list of files.
- Ignore hidden files by default in `msc sync` operations.
- Add Etag support in HuggingFace storage provider.

## Bug Fixes

- Fix List semantics in HuggingFace provider.
- Fix incorrect results from `storage_client.list()` when `base_path` contains both bucket and prefix.
- Pass timeout configurations from Python to Rust for consistent behavior.
