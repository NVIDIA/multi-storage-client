## Code contributions

### Your first issue

1. Read the project's [README.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA/multi-storage-client/blob/main/README.md) to learn how to setup the development environment.
2. Find an issue to work on. The best way is to look for the [good first issue](https://github.com/NVIDIA/multi-storage-client/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or [help wanted](https://github.com/NVIDIA/multi-storage-client/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) labels
3. Comment on the issue saying you are going to work on it.
4. Code! Make sure to update unit tests!
5. When done, [create your pull request](https://github.com/NVIDIA/multi-storage-client/compare).
6. Verify that CI passes all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks), or fix if needed.
7. Wait for other developers to review your code and update code as needed.
8. Once reviewed and approved, a multi-storage-client developer will merge your pull request.

Remember, if you are unsure about anything, don't hesitate to comment on issues and ask for clarifications!

### Managing PR labels

Each PR must be labeled according to whether it is a "breaking" or "non-breaking" change (using GitHub labels). This is used to highlight changes that users should know about when upgrading.

For multi-storage-client, a "breaking" change is one that modifies the public, non-experimental, API in a non-backward-compatible way. Backward-compatible API changes (such as adding a new keyword argument to a function) do not need to be labeled.

Additional labels must be applied to indicate whether the change is a feature, improvement, bugfix, or documentation change. See the shared multi-storage-client documentation for these labels: https://github.com/NVIDIA/kb/issues/42.

### Seasoned developers

Once you have gotten your feet wet and are more comfortable with the code, you can look at the prioritized issues of our next release in our issue board.

Look at the unassigned issues, and find an issue you are comfortable with contributing to. Start with _Step 3_ from above, commenting on the issue to let others know you are working on it. If you have any questions related to the implementation of the issue, ask them in the issue instead of the PR.

### Branches and Versions

The multi-storage-client repository follows trunk-based development around the `main` branch.

### Branch naming

Branches used to create PRs should have a name of the form `<type>-<name>` which conforms to the following conventions:

- Type:
  - fea - For if the branch is for a new feature(s)
  - enh - For if the branch is an enhancement of an existing feature(s)
  - bug - For if the branch is for fixing a bug(s) or regression(s)
- Name:
  - A name to convey what is being worked on
  - Please use dashes or underscores between words as opposed to spaces.
